		approximate the solution. These will be called `basis functions'. The amplitudes of 
		these functions will be the unknowns that you will determine. The basis functions 
		must satisfy the Dirichlet (`fixed') boundary conditions.
		\item Insert the approximate solution into the functional that is now denoted by $u_h$.
		\item Take the directional derivative of $u_h$ with respect to the unknown amplitudes of the

\note{Numerical methods for partial differential equations are tools for finding approximate
	solutions and are normally used with the aid of a computer. A number of numerical methods 
	are closely linked to a variational form of the differential equation. A group of such methods 
	are known as Galerkin methods. The Ritz method is an example of a Galerkin method, and the 
	finite element method is another. If a numerical method is properly formulated (and the equation 
	is stable), the more effort (read computer time) that is expended, the closer one gets to the 
	exact solution.}

\end{figure}
The function $u$ can be approximated by a function $u_h$ using linear combinations 
of basis functions according to the following expressions:
\begin{equation*}
u \approx u_h \quad u_h = \sum_{i} u_i \psi_i
\end{equation*}
}
\mode<handout>{
\vspace{5cm}
}
\end{frame}



\note{The reality of partial differential equations is that in most cases it is 
	not possible to find an analytical solution. This is particularly so for 
	equations on complicated geometries (as is common in engineering), nonlinear 
	equations and equations with complicated source terms and boundary conditions.
	
	Instead, an approximation of the equations needs to be constructed, typically 
	based upon different types of discretizations. These discretization methods 
	approximate the PDEs with numerical model equations, which can be solved using 
	numerical methods. The solution to the numerical model equations are, in turn, 
	an approximation of the real solution to the PDEs. The finite element method 
	(FEM) is used to compute such approximations.}

\note{Take, for example, a function $u$ that may be the dependent variable in a PDE 
	(i.e., temperature, electric potential, pressure, etc.) The function $u$ can be 
	approximated by a function uh using linear combinations of basis functions 
	according to the following expressions: 
	
	\begin{equation*}
	u \approx u_h \quad u_h = \sum_{i} u_i \psi_i
	\end{equation*}
	
	Here, $\psi_i$ denotes the basis functions and $u_i$ denotes the coefficients of 
	the functions that approximate u with uh. The figure below illustrates this 
	principle for a 1D problem. $u$ could, for instance, represent the temperature 
	along the length ($x$) of a rod that is nonuniformly heated. Here, the linear basis 
	functions have a value of 1 at their respective nodes and 0 at other nodes. In 
	this case, there are seven elements along the portion of the x-axis, where the 
	function $u$ is defined (i.e., the length of the rod).}

\note{One of the benefits of using the finite element method is that it offers great 
	freedom in the selection of discretization, both in the elements that may be used to 
	discretize space and the basis functions. In the figure above, for example, the elements 
	are uniformly distributed over the x-axis, although this does not have to be the case. 
	Smaller elements in a region where the gradient of u is large could also have been applied.\\
	
	Both of these figures show that the selected linear basis functions include very limited 
	support (nonzero only over a narrow interval) and overlap along the x-axis. Depending on 
	the problem at hand, other functions may be chosen instead of linear functions.\\

	\caption*{where $f$ is a distributed force and $h$ as a force applied at the end of the bar}
\end{figure}
The equilibrium equation can be derived by considering an infinitesimal bar: 
\mode<beamer>{
	\begin{equation*}
		- \frac{dN}{dx} = f
	\end{equation*}
}
\mode<handout>{
	\vspace{2cm}
}
where $N$ is the normal force in the bar and $f$ is the distributed force along the bar.
\end{frame}

		N = A \sigma = E A \frac{du}{dx} = EA\varepsilon
	\end{equation*}
}
\mode<handout>{
	\vspace{1.5cm}
}
where $A(x)$ is the area of the bar, $E(x)$ is Young’s modulus $u$ is the displacement and $\varepsilon =
du/dx$ is the strain.
\mode<beamer>{
	\begin{equation*}
	- \frac{d}{dx}\left(EA \frac{du}{dx}\right) = f
	\end{equation*}
}
\mode<handout>{
	\vspace{1.5cm}
}
which is a second-order differential equation. BCs:
\mode<beamer>{
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $u = 0$ at $x = 0$ (displacement or `Dirichlet' boundary condition),
	\item $EA\varepsilon = h$ at $x = L$ (force or `Neumann' boundary condition).
	\end{enumerate}
We now have a well-defined boundary value problem that can be solved.
}
\mode<handout>{
	\vspace{1cm}
}

\end{frame}
\note{To formulate a boundary value problem, we need to assume a constitutive model which
	defines the relationship between stress and deformation, and we need to supply boundary
	conditions.}

\section{Weak form}
%------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Weak form of the equilibrium equations of a 1D bar}
The general derivation of the weak form of any equation from the strong form
follows a standard procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Multiply the strong equation by a weight function $v$ which is equal to zero where
	Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions are applied, but is otherwise arbitrary 
	(Another condition is that it must be sufficiently continuous. The degree of continuity 
	required depends on the properties of the equation being considered.)
	\item Use integration by parts to `shift' derivatives to the weight function
	\item Insert the Neumann (force) boundary conditions
\end{enumerate}

We then want to find a solution $u$ to the weak form that holds for all $v$ . The weight
function is also known as the `\textit{test}' function.
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Weak form of the equilibrium equations of a 1D bar}
Multiplying equilibrium equation by an arbitrary weight function v and
integrating along the bar:
\begin{equation*}
-\int_0^L v \frac{dN}{dx}\, \mathrm{d}x. = \int_0^L v f\, \mathrm{d}x.
\end{equation*}
we require that $v(0) = 0$ because of the displacement boundary condition at $x = 0$.
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^L \frac{dv}{dx} N\, \mathrm{d}x. = \int_0^L v f\, \mathrm{d}x + v N |_{x=0}^{x=L}.
\end{equation*}
Since $v(0) = 0$, inserting the constitutive relationship and taking into account the force
boundary condition at $x = L$.
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^L \frac{dv}{dx} EA \frac{du}{dx}\, \mathrm{d}x. = \int_0^L v f\, \mathrm{d}x + v(L)h.
\end{equation*}
The task is to find $u$ with $u(0) = 0$ such that this equation is satisfied for all $v$.
\end{frame}

% Strong vs Weak form
\note{Strong form is the conventional PDE. The strong form imposes continuity and differentiability 
	requirements on the potential solutions to the equation. Weak form is an alternate representation of 
	the differential equation. The weak form relaxes these 
	requirements on solutions to a certain extent. This means that a larger set of 
	functions are solutions of the weak form. By construction all solutions of the strong 
	form satisfy the weak form but not vice-versa. \\

	Weak formulations are often referred to as `variational formulations'. In fact, the weak form 
	is more general than the strong form. 
	The weak form of an equation does not generally make an equation easier to solve 
	analytically (it may make it harder), but is usually a more suitable form for 
	mathematical analysis (allowing us to say things about the properties of the equation 
	without knowing the solution) and for numerical solution methods.}

\note{An important observation
	is that the weak form for the bar contains at most first-order derivatives, whereas the
	strong form for this problem contained second-order derivatives. We have transferred
	one derivative from the displacement field $u$ to weight function $v$ using integration by
	parts. This is a key feature of the weak form and is crucial for finite element methods.
	If the symbol $v$ in the weak form was replaced by the symbol $\delta \varepsilon$, 
	the weak form in the case of the bar resembles the virtual work equation. It is in fact 
	equivalent. However, the process that we have followed is general and does not require 
	any knowledge of virtual work, and can be applied to any differential equation.}

Approximates the PDE by replacing the unknown function (the displacement $u$ 
of the elastic bar) and the weight function ($v$) by approximate fields $u_h$ and $v_h$. Inserting these fields into the weak equilibrium equation for a bar:

	\begin{equation*}
	\int_0^L \frac{dv_h}{dx} EA \frac{du_h}{dx}\, \mathrm{d}x. = \int_0^L v_h f\, \mathrm{d}x + v_h(L)h.
	\end{equation*}
	
We now allow only a limited number of possibilities for $v_h$ and $u_h$. 

Therefore, it is now unlikely that $u_h$ will be equal to the exact solution.
